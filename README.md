# Cryptographic Random Numbers
A random number generator using cryptography algorirhtms.
Each program begins with a random number between 0 and 255 to represent a byte of data in and runs it through the cryptographic algorithm, the encrypted data is then converted back into a integer and the process continues to create a sequence of random numbers through encryption.

The thought behind the program was to see if an encrypted random number is more uniformly random than the "Random" variable.
